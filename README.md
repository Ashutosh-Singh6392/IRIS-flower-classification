# IRIS-flower-classification
To start, I began by loading the Iris dataset, which contains valuable information about various iris species. I took great care to thoroughly inspect the dataset's structure, determining its dimensions and meticulously checking for any missing data points. The dataset revealed the fascinating diversity of iris flowers, with features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width providing rich insights into each individual flower's characteristics. 

To refine our analysis and focus solely on the essential attributes defining each iris, we removed the identifier column, allowing us to center our attention on the unique floral traits.

For data preprocessing and correlation analysis, we constructed a heatmap. In this heatmap, dark blue shades represented high intensity values, while red shades indicated low intensity values, enabling us to identify any potential patterns or relationships within the data.

In the end, this project serves as a testament to the captivating synergy between nature's beauty and the insights that can be gleaned from data analysis.
